// Exercise 1: Variable Declaration
let name = "Asiphile"; 
let age = 25; 
let isStudent = true; 
console.log(name, age, isStudent);

// Exercise 2: Variable Reassignment
let favoriteColour = "Indigo"; 
console.log(favoriteColour);
favoriteColour = "Violet"; 
console.log(favoriteColour);

// Exercise 3: Arithmetic Operations
let num1 = 8;
let num2 = 3;
let sum = num1 + num2;
let difference = num1 - num2;
let product = num1 * num2;
let quotient = num1 / num2;
console.log(sum, difference, product, quotient);


//Through these JavaScript exercises, I learned the basics of variable handling, data types, operators, and control flow. In the first set of tasks, I practiced declaring and reassigning variables, and performing arithmetic operations. This helped me understand how to store and manipulate data.
